# ISSUES
1. At first ,sometimes float_input or take_command is returning NONE or string for wrong 
inputs on returning during the first iteration and its not updating the float values
as its updating the error string in the param list instead.
FIXED !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

2. gender_age integration failed due to opening of multiple cam window confusing the opencv software. so we must make a central script for all opencv integrations.
