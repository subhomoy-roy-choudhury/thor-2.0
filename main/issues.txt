# ISSUES
1. At first ,sometimes float_input or take_command is returning NONE or string for wrong 
inputs on returning during the first iteration and its not updating the float values
as its updating the error string in the param list instead.
FIXED !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

2. gender_age integration failed due to opening of multiple cam window confusing the opencv software. so we must make a central script for all opencv integrations.
FIXED !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

3. voice indentification in take command needs work. 

4. facial recogniton is not working quite well . must use the VGG model for facial recognition.

5. In pyttsx there is run and wait function which is creating problem in app.py in returning the json. So it was changed from pyttsx to gtts .
FIXED !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

6. Implemented threading and multiprocessing in text command so that it can interrupt an existing command for an important command.
FIXED !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

7. Implemented nlp Automated command system so that it can take commands and recognize the commands on the basis of deep learning and natural language processing.
FIXED !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

8. Threading and multiprocessing not working in voice command as well as in API.
